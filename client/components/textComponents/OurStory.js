      Hi, there! <br/>

      My name is Nataliya and here I will tell you the story of our breeding practice.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Back in 2015 my sister Julia made a decision to breed Scottish Folds. She has done all the research, found reputable breeders (which took months!) with healthy cats and kittens that give breeding rights and have amazing pedigrees.
      <br/>
      In 2016 we got our first two Queens - a Scottish Fold Aylin and a Scottish Straight Athena. We also got two studs to breed each queen with. (We've always bred straight to fold, and never ever fold to fold!)
      <br/>
      When we began, I was more on a neutral side. But as soon as I got Athena and spent our first month together, I fell in love with her! She is now my forever best cat in the world! And that is how I fell in the love with the breed itself. My sister Julia had no convincing to do!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Julia was always guiding me with the proper breeding practices as we were starting up. Later on, I took most things into my hands, like talking to the clients and setting up visiting.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Today, my sister still breeds in Bergenfield, NJ while I am in High Point, NC.
      <br/>
      When you inquire, I am the one who responds and guides you through the buying process. I am also the one who provides life time breeders support. However, if my sister has to be involved, she's always there to give her support and guidance!
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We are in contact with most of our clients that we've met from these past years. We are always looking forward to new photos of our graduated kittens and cats. I am really proud to say that we have met amazing people who are addicted to Scottish Folds and cats in general!
      <br/>
      Our clients are all over the United States and fly and drive to get their kittens from us all the way from Boston, Pittsburg, Richmond, Houston, San Diego, New Orleans and many others.
      <br/>
      We also provide in cabin delivery throughout US with the help of a flight nanny.â€‹
